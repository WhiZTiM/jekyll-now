-----------------------

I've been programming in C++ for some good years now. And I love writing portable, performant and ISO-C++ standard's compliant code. I'm [active on stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1621391/whiztim), currently among the global 0.5%, and the 355th legendary Gold Badge earner in C++.

While **C++** gives you unfettered control over the Performance of your Software. **C++17** gives you more control over productivity, safety and performance. I love to stay at the bleeding edge of standards and technologies, hence I've had experience writing **C++98**, **C++03**, **C++11**, **C++14**, and **C++17** - At the same time, I regularly poke my head into the ISO C++ standards committee documents ahead of ***C++20***.

PS: *Great job to the C++ Community, the ISO C++ members, and Herb Sutter!*

## Industry Skills?

*I hate being choicely. I am always excited about exploring new fields. :-)*

- I have working knowledge of concurrency and multi-threading (I claim some pretty reasonable knowledge on atomics, but absolutely no knowledge on `std::memory_order_consume`)

- Because I currently work in Security - Identity and Access Management infrastructure domain; I have been learning a lot, and gradually gainning relevant expertise daily

- Nonetheless, I know some stuff on Subsea Systems Engineering in the Oil and Gas Sector; I did an Assessed Internship with Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company, Lagos in 2014. (I enjoyed it! and I still keep some tabs on the industry :-) )

- I regularly solve algorithmic problems for fun, and to improve my problem solving skills

- I am very comfortable with template meta programming (though I get annoyed by complicated templates)

## Other languages?

Of cause. C++ wouldn't be my first and last choice for a lot of stuff. I have trained and fought wars with other Artilleries including **C**, **C#**, **Java**, **JavaScript ECMA2015 (NodeJS)** and **Python**. My current job involves a dose of **Java** and **Perl**; with some **Typescript/Javascript**, **Go**, and some toolings/scripts on DevOps.
