I am a Nigerian who is passionate about Engineering and every detail about it. I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering, ditto Production Engineering. I love Systems Engineering and Software Engineering. 
I currently work for [nHub Nigeria](http://nhubnigeria.com) (its a nice place to work). *Since I don't get to use much of C++ there, contact me if you have a C++ job for me!, here's my [CV](/cv)*. 

I've been programming in C++ for over 7 years now. And I love writing portable, performant and ISO-C++ standard's compliant code. I'm [active on stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1621391/whiztim), currently among the global 0.5%, and the 355th legendary Gold Badge earner in C++.
